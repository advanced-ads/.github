This template is meant for suggested changes that cannot be experienced or viewed by the end users. Changes to the plugin code or how we prepare it go here.

**Summary**

Start with a summary that briefly describes what this is about.

Status Quo
---

- What do we have now?
- Describe the reasoning behind it and link to related issues, commits, pull requests, if you find them.
- If you link to any code, link to the code in a release and not the `master` branch, because these links can become outdated.

Suggested changes
---

Describe the expected changes.

Priority
---

The following questions might help when estimating the priority.

- Is there an alternative solution?
- Is this a "nice to have" or is there a level of urgency? Does it save us time in the future? Why?
- Describe the pain our users (or we) are experiencing with the current solution.
- What happens / does not happen if we donâ€™t implement this?

If you are not sure, discuss it with your colleagues in a meeting before opening a new ticket.
