**Before you submit a bug**

(read and then remove this section)

If the behavior was never different and does not go against some external requirements, could this be a feature rather than a bug?

Could existing users rely on the current behavior and a change could irritate them?

If you are not sure whether this is a bug or a feature and feel that you need technical help finding it out then contact the most-appropriate developer in our team directly via Slack.

If possible, also check:

- [ ] are the latest versions of Advanced Ads and add-ons running?
- [ ] are there JavaScript issues in the browserâ€™s developer console that the user could fix before we look into it?
- [ ] can the user reproduce this on a test site?

**Describe the bug**

How to reproduce

Expected behavior

Priority

- Quantify the number of requests for this. E.g., upvotes on https://wpadvancedads.com/feature-requests/, support tickets (with links to them).
- Describe the pain our users (or we) are experiencing with the current solution.

If you are not sure, discuss it with your colleagues in a meeting before opening a new ticket.
